## Overview

SocialEngage is a social engineering tool designed to trick the administrator of a Windows PC into revealing their password. Once the admin enters their credentials, the tool opens a CMD window with administrator privileges, giving you elevated access.

This tool leverages psychological tactics to convince the user to enter their password, simulating a legitimate prompt. Itâ€™s a demonstration of how social engineering can bypass technical security measures.
